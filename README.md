## Hanasu

> Hanasu means "to speak" in Japanese.

## Why ?

- this is a spiritual successor to [ws-wrtc-client](https://github.com/soulsam480/ws-wrtc-client) that I wrote some 3 years back
- I wanted to revisit the app and redo it with a different approach

## How ?

- The stack remains more or less the same
- Frontend is on vue 3 with Element plus as UI lib (man this library is awesome)
- Backend is on soncket.io

## How to use it

- visit hanasu.sambitsahoo.com and register with a name
- this name will be stores in locastorage as your ID, ofc you can reset it
- after that it's pretty straight forward
- choose someone from list, send a request and start a conversation
- you can only talk to one person at once, this is by design
- also there are some QOL features, like small chat sounds, share links etc.
- I plan to add audio and images, but only if I have time going forward
